Alternatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`AWS Lambda <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`_

AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when 
your code is not running. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any 
type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. 
Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run 
and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to 
automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from 
any web or mobile app.


`Google Cloud Functions <https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/>`_

Google Cloud Functions is a lightweight compute solution for developers to 
create single-purpose, stand-alone functions that respond to Cloud events 
without the need to manage a server or runtime environment.


`Azure Functions <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/functions/>`_

Azure Functions is a serverless event-driven experience that extends the existing Azure App 
Service platform. These nano-services can scale based on demand, and you pay only for the 
resources that you consume.
