Introduction

Philosophy
~~~~~~~~~~

Pratai is been developed with a few `PEP 20 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020>`_ idioms in mind.

 1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
 2. Explicit is better than implicit.
 3. Simple is better than complex.
 4. Complex is better than complicated.
 5. Readability counts.
 6. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
 7. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

And some other ideas in mind.

 8. Open source matters.


All contributions to Pratai should keep these important rules in mind.
